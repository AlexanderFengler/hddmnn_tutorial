We developed an open-source Python toolbox that allows hierarchical
Bayesian parameter estimation of the DDM and LBA and is successfully
being used in various cognitive research laboratories. The benefit of
this approach is two-fold: (i) improved accuracy of individual subject
parameter recover by modeling subject similarity in a hierarchical
fashion; and (ii) full Bayesian posterior inference that obsoletes
frequentist statistics and confidence intervals. Despite prior
methodological advancements in this area, a reliable software package
implementing this method was previously not available. Special care
has been taken to make this software easy to install and use. A simple
yet powerful model description mechanism allows the creation of
arbitrarily complex models where separate parameters can be estimated
for different conditions. Additional features like
posterior-predictive-checks allow for model validation and
comparison. Finally, to facilitate cross-domain application of this
toolbox in the cognitive neurosciences, it is simple to estimate
trial-by-trial influences of e.g. brain-measures on individual model
parameters.
