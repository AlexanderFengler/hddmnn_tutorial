# HDDM-LAN(nn) Tutorial

Welcome to the **HDDM-LAN(nn) Tutorial**. Execute the instructions below to follow the tutorial in your own *google colab notebook*.
**Slides** for the *theory part* are in the file *hddm_nn_tutorial_slides.pdf*. 

## NOTE:

The content of this repository has migrated to the [main HDDM repository](https://github.com/hddm-devs/hddm/tree/master/hddm/examples) now. Please find the `lan_tutorial.ipynb` notebook by following the respective link. (Below instructions also now link to the main **HDDM** repository)

## RUN THE TUTORIAL (colab)

To directly *run the main tutorial* (from the main repository) in a **google colab notebook**, please click [this link](https://githubtocolab.com/hddm-devs/hddm/blob/master/hddm/examples/lan_tutorial.ipynb). 

After an initial discussion of HDDM features we will illustrate some end-to-end pipelines for likelihood approximation.

2. Going from simulators to inference with HDDM using MNLEs: [click here](https://githubtocolab.com/hddm-devs/hddm/blob/master/hddm/examples/mnle_to_hddm_end_to_end.ipynb)

We recommend you to check [this basic HDDM](https://githubtocolab.com/hddm-devs/hddm/blob/master/hddm/examples/hddm_basic_workshop.ipynb tutorial as well (however we will probably not get to it during our workshop).

## RUN THE TUTORIAL (via main repo)
Otherwise you can also simply clone the [HDDM repository](https://github.com/hddm-devs/hddm/tree/master) and access the tutorials directly from the **examples** folder on your local machine. (Note that installation of all necessary python packages can be tricky, depending on your local setup.)
